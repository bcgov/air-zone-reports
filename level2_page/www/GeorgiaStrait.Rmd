library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
df_cities <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/air-zone-reports/master/data/out/cities.csv')

tbl_cities <- df_cities %>%
  filter(airzone == 'Georgia Strait')  %>%
  select(Name,C1_COUNT_TOTAL) %>%
  rename(Municipality = Name, `Population (2021)` = C1_COUNT_TOTAL) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Population (2021)`)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::slice_head(n=5)

nrow(tbl_cities)
