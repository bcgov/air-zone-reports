Air zone reports are prepared each year by the B.C. Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy to summarize the levels of air pollution in reporting areas called "air zones". The reports are part of our commitment under the national [Air Quality Management System (AQMS)](https://ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report#slide-2) to better protect human health and the environment.

This annual report, titled "Air Zone Report (`r validation_year-2`-`r validation_year`)", summarizes B.C.'s air quality status, achievement of the [Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS](https://ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report#slide-7)), and assignment of management levels for the four major pollutants: fine particulate matter (PM~2.5~), ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO~2~), and sulphur dioxide (SO~2~). Management levels are assessed based on three years (`r validation_year-2`-`r validation_year`) of monitoring data. Under the principles of the AQMS, management levels define the recommended level of actions for communities in order to keep clean areas clean and continuously improve air quality.

```
Air pollution is recognized as one of the greatest environmental threat to human health ([WHO 2022](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health)). Based on Health Canada estimates, approximately 15,300 Canadians--1,900 in British Columbia--prematurely die every year due to exposure to air pollution ([Health Canada 2021](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/2021-health-effects-indoor-air-pollution.html#a2)). In order to protect human health, ministers of the environment agreed to implement the Air Quality Management System.

The national Air Quality Management System (AQMS) provides a collaborative and comprehensive approach of managing ambient (outdoor) air quality. AQMS is implemented across Canada to reduce emissions and levels of major air pollutants.

B.C. is divided into seven air zones to help manage air quality throughout the province.

The four pollutants listed below are recognized as having the most significant evidence of causing health issues and have been the primary focus of health impact studies. These pollutants are also among those that have established air quality objectives. As part of the Air Quality Management System, the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) were created to act as a driver for the continuous improvement of air quality. The CAAQS for these four pollutants have also been established as national air quality objectives under the [Canadian Environmental Protection Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/guidelines-objectives-codes-practice/guidelines-objectives.html).

This report utilizes metrics to provide a summary of each pollutant's levels and compare it to the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards. These metrics consist of three components:

-   A numerical value that represents the concentration or level of the pollutant being measured.

-   A unit of measurement that defines the kind of quantity that the numerical value represents, such as micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3) for fine particulate matter.

-   A statistical form that specifies how the numerical value was calculated using raw measurements, such as an annual average or a maximum daily average.

By utilizing these metrics, the report is able to apply CAAQS as reference to a comprehensive and standardized overview of the air quality in each reporting area,making it easier to identify and compare areas where action may be needed to improve air quality and protect public health.

<!---PM2.5 Text-->

Fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) are solid particles or liquid droplets that are suspended in air with sizes smaller than or equal to 2.5 micrometres (µm) in diameter. PM<sub>2.5</sub> are typically found in smoke, soot, dust, dirt, dispersed aerosol, and biological sources like mould, bacteria, pollen, and animal dander. When inhaled, these particles travel deep into the lungs and the bloodstream and can cause adverse health effects, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. PM<sub>2.5</sub> is considered a non-threshold pollutant, that is there are associated health effects at any level of exposure.

**Health Effects:**

-   cardiovascular and respiratory mortality

-   reduced lung function

-   chronic bronchitis

-   asthma

**Measurement and Reporting**

PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels are presented using these metrics:

-   an annual metric to estimate chronic or long term exposure

-   a 24-hour metric to estimate short term or acute exposure

**Standards and Management Levels for PM<sub>2.5</sub>**

The table below shows the colour-based management levels for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The levels were defined as part of the Air Quality Management System and are based on the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (shown as red management level). Each colour corresponds to the recommended levels of management action based on the metrics for PM<sub>2.5</sub>.

```
Ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), is a colourless, odourless and highly irritating gas that forms close to the Earth's surface. O<sub>3</sub> is a major component of smog. In contrast to "primary" pollutants which are emitted directly into the atmosphere from a source, O<sub>3</sub> is considered a "secondary" pollutant because it is formed through complex chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. While O<sub>3</sub> at ground-level is a significant environmental and health concern, approximately 10 to 40 kilometres above the Earth's surface, there is a beneficial layer of stratospheric ozone which shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Ozone is also a short-lived climate pollutant and also contributes to climate change.

**Health Effects:**

-   coughing

-   irritation of the eyes, nose, throat

-   shortness of breath

-   reduced lung function

**Measurement and Reporting**

In this report, O<sub>3</sub> levels are presented using the 8-hour metric.

**Standards and Management Levels for O<sub>3</sub>**

The table below shows the colour-based management levels for O<sub>3</sub>. The levels were defined as part of the Air Quality Management System and are based on the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (shown as red management level). Each colour corresponds to the recommended levels of management action based on the metrics for O<sub>3</sub>.

  <p>
```
Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) belongs to the oxides of nitrogen group of compounds (NOx) that are formed primarily through the burning of fossil fuels. While transportation sources represent more than half of all emissions, energy extraction and industrial processes also emit significant amounts of NOx, mainly as Nitrogen Oxide (NO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). NO2 at higher concentrations has a strong, harsh odour and can typically be seen over large cities as a brownish haze. Once formed, NO<sub>2</sub> can combine with water molecules in the air to form compounds like nitric acid and nitrous acid. Ultimately, these compounds fall to earth through precipitation (such as rain, snow and fog) where they contribute to the acidification and eutrophication of ecosystems.

**Health Effects:**

-   reduced lung function

-   breathing problems such as coughing and wheezing

-   aggravate asthma

**Measurement and Reporting**

In this report, NO<sub>2</sub> levels are presented using these two metrics: 
    - annual metric to estimate long term exposure, and 
    - 1-hour metric to estimate short term or acute exposure.

**Standards and Management Levels for NO<sub>2</sub>**

The table below shows the colour-based management levels for NO<sub>2</sub>. The levels were defined as part of the Air Quality Management System and are based on the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (shown as red management level). Each colour corresponds to the recommended levels of management action based on the metrics for NO<sub>2</sub>.

  <p>
```
Sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is a colourless gas that belongs to a group of sulphur-containing gases called sulphur oxides (SOx). SO<sub>2</sub> is emitted when fossil fuels or raw materials containing sulphur are burned in industrial processes (ore processing, smelting), electric power generation, or marine transportation. Large quantities are also during the extraction and processing of fossil fuels. SO<sub>2</sub> contributes to the formation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and smog, and when combined with water molecules in the air, it can form compounds like sulfuric acid, which eventually falls to earth as acid rain.


**Health Effects:**

-   harms the respiratory system of high risk individuals

**Measurement and Reporting**

In this report, SO<sub>2</sub> levels are presented using these two metric: 
    - annual metric to estimate long term exposure, and 
    - 1-hour metric as estimate of acute (short term) exposure.

**Standards and Management Levels for SO<sub>2</sub>**


The table below shows the colour-based management levels for SO<sub>2</sub>. The levels were defined as part of the Air Quality Management System and are based on the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (shown as red management level).

```
Monitoring stations are strategically placed in areas of concern, such as near industrial facilities, busy roads, or densely populated areas, to monitor air quality. Various agencies operate these stations, including the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Metro Vancouver Regional District, community airshed groups and roundtables, industrial permit holders, and other agencies like BCHydro, Prince Rupert Port Authority, and the British Columbia Energy Regulator (formerly BC Oil and Gas Commission).

It is important to note that not all stations are used for reporting under the Air Quality Management System (AQMS). There are compliance and fenceline stations, that are typically located within the perimeter of industrial facilities. These stations are designed to monitor emissions from those facilities and measurements do not represent any population exposure.

There are 27 areas in the province where the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is reported. AQHI is an essential tool for the near real-time communication of the health impacts of air quality. The AQHI provides important advice to vulnerable populations in impacted areas, allowing them to make informed decisions to reduce their exposure to pollutants.

Use the map below to find the locations of air quality monitoring stations and AQHI areas.

```
Each air zone (except the Northwest) is assigned a colour-based management level for each of the four pollutants (fine particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide). These management levels are based on the levels of pollution measured from communities inside the air zone.The management levels also correspond to air zone management actions that are recommended under the Air Quality Management System. Provinces and territories, in collaboration with communities, use the management levels as framework to develop action plans and policies to address the issue of the pollutant.

<!--preprocess management level-->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#display management level table
a <- add_mgmt_legend()
# print(a)
```

Pollutants that traveled across boundaries (trans-boundary) or are formed from exceptional events such as wildfires, are typically omitted from the assessment in order to focus on community-level actions and continuously improve air quality. The AQMS also applies other regulatory and non-regulatory instruments. This includes Base Level Industrial Emission Requirements to reduce emissions from industry and industrial equipment, and an inter-governmental collaboration to reduce vehicle emissions.

### Summary of Management Levels

-   The Central Interior and Southern Interior air zones are assigned red management level for fine particulate matter (PM~2.5~) due to high levels of PM~2.5~ at Houston, Vanderhoof, and Grand Forks. Under a red management level, the Air Quality Management System recommends taking actions in order to achieve the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards.
-   The Lower Fraser Valley air zone is assigned orange management level for ozone. These are due to the levels observed at Hope, Maple Ridge, and Mission.
-   The Central Interior, Georgia Strait, Lower Fraser Valley, Northeast, and Southern Interior air zones are under orange management level for nitrogen dioxide (NO~2~). These are due to levels at urban and industrial locations in the area. 
-   The Southern Interior air zone is assigned red management level for sulphur dioxide (SO~2~) due to the high SO~2~ levels at Trail. All other air zones are under yellow or green management levels.

```
Pollution from fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) remains a major air quality issue in British Columbia and many other parts of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers PM<sub>2.5</sub> the most dangerous because of its health effects and the number of people affected. WHO estimates around 4.2 million people die each year due to pollution from fine particulate matter.

The Western part of North America experiences severe air quality issues from PM<sub>2.5</sub> during late summer and early fall due to the prevalence of wildfires. Smoke from wildfires can travel vast distances and affect large areas.

Wood burning for residential heating during the winter months can also cause local air pollution problems. This method of heating releases several pollutants, including PM<sub>2.5</sub>, which can have negative effects on air quality and public health.

The interactive graphics below shows the number of days that B.C.'s air zones experience 24-hour PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels that are higher than the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) of 27 µg/m<sup>3</sup>. Use the graph below to examine the effects of wildfire smoke on the air quality of British Columbia.

high_airzone_season <- pm_days_summary %>%
  filter(AIRZONE == order_pm25[1]) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))
```

Based on the graph above, in `r validation_year`, British Columbia experienced `r BC_days_with_highpm` days where 24-hour levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exceeded the CAAQS threshold of 27µg/m<sup>3</sup>. Out of these, `r BC_days_with_highpm_wildfire` days were from wildfire smoke that commonly occur during the summer and early fall seasons.

-   In the `r order_pm25[1]` air zone, there were `r high_airzone_pm` days where the 24-hour PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels exceeded CAAQS

    -   `r high_airzone_pm_wildfire` of these days were due to the seasonal wildfires, the other `r (high_airzone_pm-high_airzone_pm_wildfire)` were most likely from local emission sources.

    -   `r high_airzone_season$total[high_airzone_season$seasons == 'Winter']` of these days occured during the winter season. High PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels during the winter are mostly due to smoke from residential heating.

In British Columbia, managing air quality is primarily done through provincial acts and regulations, as well as involvement from the federal, regional, and municipal governments. The key legislations governing air quality and environmental issues in the province are the [Environmental Management Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/03053_00_multi) and the [Waste Discharge Regulation](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/45_320_2004). These regulations impose specific conditions on certain types of activities, such as businesses and industries, to ensure that they are conducted in a way that minimizes their impact on the environment.
